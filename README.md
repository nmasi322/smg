### SMG Assessment 
Hello 👋 I'm Divinfavour. 

### How to run on lacal machine / instructions on how to run the application.
- You can clone the repo 🤷🏾‍♀️ the do "npm install" to install dependencies.
- On the home route, when you click on a user, you need to scroll down to see the user's details. Same for the posts.
- On the "Search posts" route, the pagination works fine and react-paaginate was used to work on it. 

### How I built it and problems I faced.
- I implemented many hooks in this application and it was a challenge and also a test on my knowledge of react hooks. 
- I had to google and watch a lot of stuffs on youtube, and I am not done with the implementation because my "add user" and "delete useer" routes are not yet added.
- The dummy API given was not working on my location (I don't know why) unless I use a VPN which is on a friend's system. 
- I ended up using another API that does majorly whaat the dummy API given does, but some data were not given. You'll see in the application . So I had to make do with what I had 🤷🏾‍♀️ 
- Lastly, if given enough time, I can finish the application, and I hope I am granted this opportunity 🥹

Thank you! 😁
Divine.
